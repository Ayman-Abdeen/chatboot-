Apply Petroleum Jelly to make sure that the wound is moist for quick healing. Finally cover the cut with a sterile bandage. Pain relievers such as acetaminophen can be applied.\n",

Remove dirt or other particles from the wound using sterilized tweezers.For a mild scrape that’s not bleeding, leave the wound uncovered.If the wound is bleeding, use a clean cloth or bandage, and apply gentle pressure to the area to stop any bleeding.Cover a wound that bled with a thin layer of topical antibiotic ointment, like Bacitracin, or a sterile moisture barrier ointment, like Aquaphor. Cover it with a clean bandage or gauze. Gently clean the wound and change the ointment and bandage once per day.Watch the area for signs of infection, like pain or redness and swelling. See your doctor if you suspect infection.\n",
            "You: I was exposed to stings\n",
            "Aymon: Remove any stingers immediately. Some experts recommend scraping out the stinger with a credit card. Applying ice to the site may provide some mild relief. Apply ice for 20 minutes once every hour as needed. Wrap the ice in a towel or keep a cloth between the ice and skin to keep from freezing the skin. Taking an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or a nonsedating one such as loratadine (Claritin) will help with itching and swelling. Take acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin)for pain relief as needed. Wash the sting site with soap and water. Placing hydrocortisone cream on the sting can help relieve redness, itching, and swelling.\n",
            "You: What to do if I have splinters?\n",
            "Aymon: 1. SOAK IT IN EPSOM SALTS. Dissolve a cup of the salts into a warm bath and soak whatever part of the body has the splinter. Failing that, you can also put some of the salts onto a bandage pad and leave it covered for a day; this will eventually help bring the splinter to the surface. 2. VINEGAR OR OIL. Another simple way to draw out that stubborn splinter is to soak the affected area in oil (olive or corn) or white vinegar. Just pour some in a bowl and soak the area for around 20 to 30 minutes,\n",

To help stop swelling, compress the ankle with an elastic bandage until the swelling stops. In most cases, pain relievers — such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve, others) or acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) are enough to manage the pain of a sprained ankle.\n",

Avoid using your muscle for a few days, especially if movement causes an increase in pain and also Apply ice immediately after injuring your muscle. This will minimize swelling. Don’t put ice directly on your skin. Use an ice pack or wrap ice in a towel. To reduce swelling, wrap the affected area with an elastic bandage until swelling comes down.\n",
